## Description

Pixel Party is a community based pixel placement game in which members can place pixels on a canvas in between cool down periods. The game fosters creativity, collaboration and competition within our user base.

## Installation

Use your web browser, either on desktop or mobile, to navigate to:

[https://pixel-party.onrender.com](https://pixel-party.onrender.com)

Sign up or register to start placing your pixels.

For development purposes:

1. Clone the repository using the following commands in terminal or bash:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Zubrungus/pixel-party.git
   cd pixel-party
   ```
2. Open the repo in VS Code and open the integrated terminal at the root level and run the following commands:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```

## Usage

After a user signs up or logs in with their username and password, they may choose a color from the pallete, and place a pixel on to the canvas provided that thier cool down period has expired.

Users can zoom the canvas in and out and drag it where they want to on the screen. The toggle grid button displays the canvas grid for precision placing.
